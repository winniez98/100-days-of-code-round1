# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: 

**Today's Progress**: I started Angela Yu's Udemy Course [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). I learned about using variables and created a Band Name Generator.


**Thoughts:** I took an Introduction to Computer Programming course back in 2017 so a lot of this is review so far.

### Day 2: 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about datatypes and how to manipulate strings. For today's project, I made a tip calculator. 

**Thoughts**: This was a good review of datatypes and casting to different datatypes, especially after someone has entered an input.

### Day 3: 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about control flow and logical statements. I made a Choose Your Own Adventure game!

**Thoughts**: I love `if` statments. They're the one part that stuck with me from my Introduction to Computer Programming course and it made me so happy to learn them again.

### Day 4:

**Today's Progress**: I learned about randomisation using the `Random` module. Using what I learned, I made a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

**Thoughts**: I keep forgetting that `random.choice()` exists so my code wasn't the most simple at times. I will have to remember it and use Google to search if there's simpler way to do things!

### Day 5:

**Today's Progress**: I learned about fo loops today and how to use `range()` in for loops. I created a password generator.

**Thoughts**: I really like loops too, so I'm happy they've been covered.

**Link(s) to work**: [Password Generator](https://replit.com/@winniez98/password-generator-start#main.py)


### Day 6:

**Today's Progress**: I learned about the while loop and making functions today, and how they an be used for code that needs to be called several times. I played a coding challenge called Karel using loops and functions. 

**Thoughts**: Functions was something that I know I've struggled with. Relearning them has helped, and it will be something I know I'll need to practice a lot. 


### Day 7:

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about breaking down a complex problem into smaller problems and creating flow charts. I coded a Hangman game.

**Thoughts**: I know this is something that's really important when it comes to programming. The Hangman challenge felt intimidating until I created a flow chart and got a better idea of where to start and how to break it into smaller problems.

**Link(s) to work**: [Hangman](https://replit.com/@winniez98/Day-7-Hangman-5-Start#main.py)


### Day 8:

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Function paramters and created a Caeser Cipher.

**Thoughts**: Everything felt pretty straight forward today. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Caeser Cipher](https://replit.com/@winniez98/caesar-cipher-4-start#main.py) 


### Day 9:

**Today's Progress**: I learned about dictionaries and nesting. I created a Secret Auction.

**Thoughts**: Nesting makes my head hurt. It can get so confusing, especially nested dictionaries.

**Link(s) to work**: [Secret Auction](https://replit.com/@winniez98/blind-auction-start#main.py)


### Day 10

**Today's Progress**: I learned about functions with outputs and how `return` differs from `print`. I made a simple calculator.

**Thoughts**: This was a concept I was confused about before and Angela made it really clear in her course. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator](https://replit.com/@winniez98/calculator-start#main.py) 


### Day 11

**Today's Progress**: I finished the first capstone, a Blackjack game.

**Thoughts**: Coding a Blackjack game was really intimidat)ing and I didn't know where to start. However, the way Angela Yu broke it down made it simple and easy to tackle. I will need to work on figuring out how to break down complex problems and just overcoming the fear of even figuring out how to break them down.

### Day 12

Starting today, I will also track my data science bootcamp progress. So far, I learned about MySQL and data visualisation using Tableau. We also learned about using Python for data science. Specifically, we covered Numpy and Pandas. 

**Today's Progress**: I learned about global and local scope. I coded a number guessing game. In bootcamp, I learned about plotting in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I also started learning about some statistics such as the 'Central Limit Theorem'

**Thoughts**: I learned about this briefly in my bootcamp and it was nice to hear about it in more detail. The game was difficult to code, and making functions is definitely something I need to work on.

### Day 13: Feb 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about debugging and a few tips of how to approach debugging. In bootcamp, I started learn more about statistics that we'll be using.

**Thoughts**: I didn't realise I've been using most of the tips already, but I'll make sure to implement a few other ones.


### Day 14: Feb 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I coded a Higher-Lower game using Python. I also started my weekly assignment for bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: While the Higher-Lower seemed intimidating to write, once I broke down the large problem into much smaller ones, it felt very straight-forward and easy to code! However, I'm struggling with when to define a function and when not to. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Higher-Lower Game](https://replit.com/@winniez98/higher-lower-start) 


### Day 15: Feb 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I worked on my weekly project for BrainStation's Data Science Bootcamp. I've been exploring a mosquito dataset from the city of Chicago, Illinois. I mainly focused on data cleaning and wrangling using Python (Pandas). 

**Thoughts**: I know people say that the majority of data science is cleaning  and wrangling data, but it still took longer than I expected it would!


### Day 16: Feb 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished my weekly bootcamp project. I finished cleaning the data by dealing with null values and did exploratory data analysis (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
I also made a coffee machine program! 

**Thoughts**: Dealing with null values was definitely difficult. I had a hard time choosing how to deal with them and ended up doing a lot of research.
I've finally gotten a better grasp of when to define a function. Today, I really struggled with using nested dictionaries. All the nesting makes my brain hurt and it's difficutl to figure out how to acccess them sometimes.

### Day 17: Feb 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started learning about object oriented programming.

**Thoughts**: This was a concept I struggled with when taking my Introduction to Computer Programming course and I think I'm starting to get a better grasp of it this time.


### Day 18: Feb 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about creating objects and how to acccess attributes/methods. I re-coded the Coffee Machine project from Day 16 using OOP. 
I also learned about logistic regression and how to model it in Python. 

**Thoughts**: When re-coding the Cofee Machine, it was difficult to grasp how to use OOP, but once I did, it was so much easier and less confusing then the first time. The analogies Angela used also made it way easier to understand OOP. 
Logistic regression kind of made my head spin, but has some really cool applications!

### Day 19: Feb 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to create a class, how initialize attributes in it, and how to create methods. I started creating a quiz game using classes that I create! 
In bootcamp, I learned about A/B testing, ANOVA, and non-parametric statistics. I also did some Numpy review. 

**Thoughts** OOP and creating and using classes was a concept I struggled with a lot back when I learned a bit of programming in university and it feels easier to understand and know how to use this time aroumd. However, I'm still struggling with sometimes realising that something is an object and that I should be calling its attribute or a specific method.

### Day 20: Feb 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Less coding today than usual. I spent most of my time today reviewing how to do statistical analysis in Python, when to use these specific tests, and a bit of the math behind them. I started my weekly assignment, where I'm doing statistical analysis in Python on the mosquito dataset I cleaned and explored last week.

**Thoughts**: The statistcal concepts are making a lot more sense and I feel like I understand them in isolation, but I will need to review and understand them some more to know when to use which ones. I might create a table to help with this. 


### Day 21: Feb 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Today, I finished the coding the Quiz Game using OOP.
At bootcamp, I learned how to use the command line and wrote some basic scripts! I also reviewed logistic and linear regression.

**Thoughts**: I'm sometimes still struggling with the concept that some of the objects I'm able to access something like the attribute of an object that I'm working with. I will definitely need a lot more practice. The command line felt straightforward. I used it before at work, so I was mostly comfortable with what I was doing. Scripting is new though, and it seems like a fun concept!

### Day 22: Feb 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Turtle and the GUI in Python. I also created some simple artwork. 
I also worked on my weekly assignment and did some statistical analysis.

**Thoughts**: It was really fun to create some simple graphics using Turtle! I'm looking foward to creating a project using this. 
While working on my weekly project, I was surprised at how much stats I already knew. I definitely know more than I think.


### Day 23: Feb 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I played around with Turtle some more and created a Spirograph. 
I worked on my weekly assignment and did some statistical analysis. I started doing some modeling.

**Thoughts**: Turtles are quite fun. Linear modelling seemed simple, but knowing which variables to add/remove is proving to be difficult.


### Day 24: Feb 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished my weekly assignment by building some linear regression and logistic regression models.

**Thoughts**: The linear model was more difficult to build than I thought it would be and it took a long time. ITwas really frustrating testing which variables to add/remove from the model when everything seemed to make the model worse. The logistic regression was a bit easier. 


### Day 25: Feb 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practiced some scripting. I wrote some scripts using regex and another script to automate some simple processes like creating new folders and copying files to different directories based on their labels.
I also finally finished the Turtle graphic project. I created some dot artwork! 

**Thoughts**: Scripting is so cool! I don't understand it completely, so it's definitely something I want to practice more. 
I'm starting to get the hang of objects and classes.

### Day 26: Feb 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about event listeners and how to use them with the Turtle class. I also learned about higher order functions. Using event listeners and higher order functions, I created a simple Etch a Sketch app that takes input from your keyboard and creates a drawing. I also learned about object instances and states. I also created a turtle racing game where 6 turtles of different colours race and you try to guess who will be the winner. 

**Thoughts**: I'm getting more comfortable with OOP and it's cool to be able to use keyboard inputs.

### Day 27: Feb 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about creating virtual environments and how to create Python packages. I also started creating a Snake game using OOP.

**Thoughts**: While I'm understanding methods and attributes and how to use them, I still struggle with creating classes. I will definitely be reviewing that and getting some more practice in. 

**Link(s) to work**: [Snake Game start](https://github.com/winniez98/100-days-of-code-projects/tree/main/Day20and21_SnakeGame) 


### Day 28: Feb 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned about class inheritance and slicing in Python. Using this knowledge, I finished making the Snake game I started yesterday.
In bootcamp, I used Plotly to make interactive data visualisations. I also learned about debugging and unit testing.

**Thoughts**: The first time I learned about class inheritance, it was confusing, so learning it from a different perspective and being able to apply it helped. I really enjoy creating data visualisations so Plotly was really fun! I don't quite understandhow to write unit tests. It was a concept I struggled with when I took an Intro to Computer Programming course so this will be something I will need to seek other resources and use office hours to understand better.

### Day 29: Feb 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: In bootcamp, we did a data analytics challenge where we were put in groups and had to answer different business questions posed by specific "executives". We then presented our findings to the rest of the class. I also started making a Pong game using OOP in Python!.

**Thoughts**: The data analytics challenge was really difficult. The questions posed were vague so we had to brainstorm more specific ones to tackle and this was difficult. It was nice to work in a group though and bounce ideas off of others! We used Tableau to create a lot of visualisations and the educators were impressed. While creating the Pong game, I'm starting to get a better grasp of OOP. I find that it helps make my code more organized and know when to use functions.

### Day 30: Feb 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished making the Pong game in Python using OOP! 

**Thoughts**: Parts of it were difficult, but I think OOP made it easier to organize to organize my thoughts in writing a more complicated program. I'm sometimes forgetting that I can use OOP to create an attribute and instead, I create a variable in the main.py file, but I will try to remember this in the future.

### Day 31: Feb 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I made a Turtle Crossing Game, where you try to get the turtle to the other side of the screen while avoiding "cars". 
I also created a data wireframe and sprint plan for my bootcamp capstone!

**Thoughts**: Creating this game helped me understand OOP. I realized that I wasn't completely clear on when to create a variable in a class as an attribute vs defining it as a variable in a method, and this project helped clear this up.
Planning out my data science bootcamp capstone also made me really excited to get started. I can't wait to get started on my capstone!

### Day 32: Feb 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about absolute filepaths vs relative filepaths and how to read/write different types of files in Python. Using this knowledge, I updated my snake game to include a high score file. I also created a mail merge project, where I can automate the personalization of letters I write to different people. Im bootcamp, we learned about using R for statistical analysis. 

**Thoughts**: Using files and being able to automate the changing of names using a simple mail merger program I wrote was super cool. I always read about how people write code to automate things and it was cool to finally be able to see it in action. R was review from my Big Data in Health course from my Master's but I also learned more about it, such as using Plotly and also that functions like group_by also exist in R.

### Day 33: Feb 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: In bootcamp, I learned about Git and version control! We practiced making commits and push and pull requests. I also reviewed Pandas as part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python. I created a USA State Quiz! 

**Thoughts**: I've been looking forward to learn more about Git and version control and how to be making push/pull requests form the command line. I've been making changes in GitHub itself, which I know is bad practice. I can't wait to put the skills I learn to use!

### Day 34: Feb 28, 2022

**Today's Progress: I learned about list and dictionary comprehension. I created a NATO alphabet project that takes an input and returns a list of the corresponding NATO alphabet. I also learned more about machine learning using Scikit learn, specifically decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

**Thoughts**: I really like list comprehensions. It makes everything so much easier. While doing the project, I forgot that the list comprehension includes the loop so that's something I will need to keep reminding myself. It's just hard to believe it's so few lines of code! Machine learning is cool, but also kind of confusing. Will need a lot of review.
